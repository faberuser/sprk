## Building the Server

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.9+ ([Install from https://rustup.rs](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/))
- SQLite ([bundled with the project](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html))

### Build Steps

```bash
# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at target/release/sprk-server.exe (Windows)
# Or target/release/sprk-server (Linux/Mac)
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Run the server (default port 8080)
cargo run --release

# Or run the binary directly
./target/release/sprk-server
```

The server will:

1. Create a SQLite database file (`sprk.db`) on first run
2. Initialize all required tables
3. Start listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8080`

### Patching the Client

Use the unified patcher to patch both `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and `resources.assets` in one command — just point it at your game client root folder:

```batch
scripts\patch.bat "D:\path\to\game\client"
scripts\patch.bat --restore "D:\path\to\game\client"
```

Or via PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\patch.ps1 -ClientPath "D:\path\to\game\client"
.\scripts\patch.ps1 -ClientPath "D:\path\to\game\client" -Restore
```

This will:

1. Run the DLL patcher (`scripts/DllPatcher`) — creates a backup `Assembly-CSharp.dll.backup_before_patch` on first run
2. Patch `resources.assets` to redirect the query host URL to your local server (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
3. Both done in one command with just the client folder path

#### DLL Patcher CLI

`DllPatcher` and `DllDisasm` also accept the client root as a CLI argument:

```bash
dotnet run --project scripts/DllPatcher -- "D:\path\to\game\client"
dotnet run --project scripts/DllDisasm -- "D:\path\to\game\client"
```
